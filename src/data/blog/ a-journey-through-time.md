In the world of web development, 404 pages are often an afterthought. But they present a unique opportunity to create memorable experiences for users who've stumbled upon non-existent pages. Today, we'll explore three brilliantly crafted 404 pages that pay homage to classic operating system error screens.

_This post is based on the [404s](https://github.com/cloughrm/404s/) project by [cloughrm](https://github.com/cloughrm), a collection of self-contained 404 pages that you can easily integrate into your web projects._

## 1. Windows 95 Blue Screen of Death

The Windows 95 BSOD 404 page perfectly captures the essence of the classic Windows 95 error screen. With its signature blue background (#06059E) and monospace font, it recreates the familiar "fatal exception" message that many users encountered during the early days of personal computing. The page features:

- Classic Windows 95 styling with the iconic gray Windows header
- A blinking cursor at the bottom (recreated using JavaScript)
- The familiar "Press any key to continue" message
- Two bullet points with the classic asterisk icons
- The ominous "fatal exception 0D" message

## 2. Windows 8 Blue Screen

Moving forward in time, the Windows 8 BSOD 404 page captures the more modern, minimalist approach to error screens. This version features:

- The signature Windows 8 blue background (#1E5AAA)
- The iconic sad face emoji ":("
- A dynamic progress counter that counts up to 99%
- The familiar "Your PC ran into a problem" message
- A reference to the "HAL_INITIALIZATION_FAILED" error code

The page uses the Noto Sans font family and includes a JavaScript-powered progress counter that adds a touch of authenticity to the experience.

## 3. macOS Kernel Panic

The macOS Kernel Panic 404 page takes a different approach, recreating the classic macOS kernel panic screen. This version:

- Features a light gray background (#AFAFBC)
- Includes multilingual support (English, French, German, and Japanese)
- Uses the Helvetica Neue font family
- Incorporates a power button image
- Maintains the classic macOS error message style

## Technical Implementation

All three pages are self-contained HTML files that require no external dependencies (except for the Windows 8 page which uses Google Fonts). They use modern CSS techniques like:

- Flexbox and table display for vertical centering
- Responsive design principles
- Custom styling to match their respective operating systems
- JavaScript for interactive elements (blinking cursors, progress counters)

## Conclusion

These 404 pages demonstrate how error pages can be transformed from frustrating experiences into nostalgic moments of delight. They serve as a reminder that even error pages can be an opportunity for creativity and user engagement. Whether you're a fan of classic Windows, modern Windows, or macOS, there's a 404 page here that will bring back memories of computing past.

To use any of these pages, simply copy the desired directory to your project's 404 location. Each implementation is self-contained and ready to use, making it easy to add a touch of nostalgia to your website's error handling.
